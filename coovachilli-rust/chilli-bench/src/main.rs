    Placeholder for CoovaChilli-Rust Performance Benchmarks

    This crate is intended to house the performance benchmarking suite for comparing
    the Rust implementation against the original C version. A full-scale network
    benchmark requires a controlled environment and external tooling. This file
    outlines the strategy and methodology.

    ## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

    The following metrics are critical for evaluating the performance of a captive portal:

    1.  **Throughput:** The maximum data rate (e.g., in Gbps) that the application can
        forward for a single client and for multiple concurrent clients.
    2.  **Latency:** The packet delay introduced by the application. This should be
        measured under no load and under heavy load.
    3.  **Authentication Rate:** The number of new client sessions that can be fully
        authenticated per second. This is a measure of control plane performance.
    4.  **Max Concurrent Sessions:** The maximum number of authenticated sessions that can
        be maintained simultaneously without significant performance degradation or
        resource exhaustion.
    5.  **Resource Usage:**
        -   **CPU Utilization:** Measured as a percentage under different load levels.
        -   **Memory Usage:** Measured in MB, tracking allocations as the number of
            sessions grows.

    ## Proposed Tooling

    -   **Traffic Generation:** `iperf3` is the industry standard for measuring network
        throughput between two endpoints.
    -   **Authentication Load (RADIUS):** The `radclient` utility (part of FreeRADIUS)
        can be scripted to send a high volume of authentication requests.
    -   **HTTP Load (UAM):** `wrk`, `ab` (Apache Benchmark), or a similar HTTP load
        testing tool can be used to benchmark the captive portal's web server.
    -   **System Monitoring:** `top`, `htop`, `dstat`, and `/proc/meminfo` can be used
        to monitor CPU and memory usage of the `chilli-bin` process.

    ## Example Benchmark Scenario (Throughput)

    1.  **Setup:**
        -   Machine A: Runs the traffic generator client (e.g., `iperf3 -c <chilli_ip>`).
        -   Machine B: Runs CoovaChilli (C or Rust version).
        -   Machine C: Runs the traffic generator server (e.g., `iperf3 -s`).
        -   Network: Machine A connects to the 'WAN' side of CoovaChilli, Machine C
            connects to the 'LAN' side. CoovaChilli must route traffic between them.

    2.  **Execution:**
        -   Start the CoovaChilli instance.
        -   Manually authenticate Machine A's session.
        -   Run `iperf3` test for a fixed duration (e.g., 60 seconds).
        -   Monitor CPU/memory on Machine B.

    3.  **Analysis:**
        -   Compare the `iperf3` throughput results between the C and Rust versions.
        -   Compare the resource usage on Machine B between the two versions.

    This framework can be extended to test other KPIs, such as scripting thousands of
    DHCP/RADIUS authentications to measure session setup rate.
